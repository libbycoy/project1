#### Overview

Mindful Drawwwing is a social web app that allows you to do the currently popular practice of "Mindful Colouring" in the browser.

You can create a drawing by first choosing a template or texture in the panel to the right which is a much simpler version of an Adobe Illustrator palette. Then, you can select colours and save your palette while you are working. Finally, you can save and download your paintings. You can also favourite others' paintings, which will save to your gallery.

The app uses Ruby and Rails and includes three models. The focus of this project was the HTML5 canvas board which allows you to colour-in templates of line drawings as you would on paper with Mindful colouring. The canvas board and its components were all created using jquery/javascript.
